Manually track differences between versions of classic literary texts.

I want to print classic literary texts, using services such as lulu.com.
The quality of freely available, public domain texts online is not always 100% reliable.
In order to produce a text of high quality, you need to edit such texts in detail.
I'm using this project to track my sources of texts, and the sets of corrections that I want to apply to them.

As expected, most corrections are minor, but some are not.

It's surprising how errors can sometimes propagate from one source to another for a long time.
