Manually track differences between versions of classic literary texts.

I want to print classic literary texts, using services such as lulu.com.
The quality of freely available, public domain texts online is not always 100% reliable.
In order to produce a text of high quality, you need to edit such texts in detail.
I'm using this project to track my sources of texts, and the sets of corrections that I want to apply to them.

As expected, most corrections are minor, but some are not.

It's surprising how errors can sometimes propagate from one source to another for a long time.

Here's an example from chapter 3 of _Anne of Green Gables_, first published in 1908:


"Will you please call me Cordelia?" she said eagerly.

"_Call_ you Cordelia? Is that your name?"

You can see this in context [here](https://archive.org/details/annegreengables00montgoog/page/n49/mode/2up), in the 
first edition.

The problem is the italics. It doesn't belong there, in my opinion.
In that utterance, the most natural candidate for italics is the name _Cordelia_.
It's not the verb _Call_. 
The italics is meant to call attention to the odd part of the thought. 
The odd part of the thought isn't the verb in this case, it's the odd name she's asking to be called.

If this is an error, it has existed for over 100 years, and is still present in all 
published versions of the text.
